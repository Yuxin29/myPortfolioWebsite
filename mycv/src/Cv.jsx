            <h2 style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>About</h2>
            <p> My professional story is one of building—first with concrect and bricks, and now with code. </p> 

            <p> After years ( 2014 - 2025) of journey an architect across Shanghai, USA, Rotterdam, and Helsinki, 
                I realized my passion lay in the systematic thinking, precise execution and complex project management that underpin both architecture and software development. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Shifting to digital building, I undertook the rigorous curriculum at Hive Helsinki, building a deep technical foundation in C, C++, and Python, with a focus on algorithms and low-level problem-solving. </p>
            
            <p>
                I am now diving into web development with Javascript and React.
            </p>

            <p>
            I now excited to this unique blend of coordination experience, system-level thinking and user-oriented attitude to contribute to software engineering.
